dotfiles
======

My standard config files.

I use [ghar](https://github.com/philips/ghar) to install these to my homedir.

On Mac, the `.fonts` directory does nothing. Install the fonts in the Font Book
app to make them available to the system. My current favorite in Terminal is
`Meslo LGS Nerd Font Mono`.
